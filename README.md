# Cindy_FullBodyTrack_Final

My final project is a camera-tracking app, and this is a screenshot of my final project.
The camera will be the most basic device in my project. The idea for my project is the equaling of people in all over the world. No matter how tall or how short the person is, they will look the same height when they shouted by the camera.
When I started the project, I want to use a camera to track a bunch of people at the same time. Those people will be in the different height, but they all will look like the same height on the screen, which been shot by the camera. When people go into the area, which can be tracked by the camera, the camera will record every frame and adjust the size to one size. Then the final look will be a lot of same height people standing close to each other.
When I finish my project, there are something cannot be reached. The shot area of the camera will be very limited. The camera only can track less than three people at the same time, and if the people stand too close or too far from the camera, it cannot be tracked. The biggest problem for the project is that there is no background that is gray, because the background will give a bad influence for tracking people. Otherwise, this project works very well. When two people get into the camera, the coding will re-size these two people's size. Finally, they will be the same size on the screen.
Although it is very hard, it let me learn a lot of things. Now this is just a basic idea and basic present. There are a lot of things that I did not reach. I will continue perfecting this project. I will add a background to instead in the future, and I also will make the camera more sensitive.
